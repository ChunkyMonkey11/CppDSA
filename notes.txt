What is a data structure?
A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficently.


Defining a List:
A List is an example of an Abstract Data Type(ADT)
 - Store a given number of elements of any type
 - Read elements by position
 - Modify element at a position

Arrays are concrete implementations. 

Abstract Data Types(ADTS):
Define data and operations but don't have implementations.

Linked List:
- Typically not aligned in memory stored at different locations.
- In a singly linked list each node is defined as a struct with int data, and a pointer to the next node.

Array:
    - Cost of accesing an element.
        - O(1) - constant operation
        - Because Array is stored as one contigous block of memory
        e.g say we have an array A
        Base Address 200
        Address of A[i]
        = 200 + i x 4 
        so say we want to find the 6th element of an array under the hood the memory of that element would be 
        200 + 6 x 4 = 222 this is how the memory address would be calculated. 
    
    -  Memory Useage
        -Array is fixed size.
        - There is used memory and unused memory. Used is the stored values and unused is the extra space waiting to be filled.
        - Memory may not be available as one large block

    - Cost of inserting an element:
        - Beginning - O(n)
            - At the beginning of a list to insert we still need to shift all elements to the right by 1 to make a space at the beginning for insertion.
        - At end - O(1)
            - If there is space in the array we just write to the next highest index of the array(Case of dynamic array where we grow the array when full.)
            - If array is full then the cost of inserting at the end will be O(n) since we would need to create a new array with double capacity and write the elements over to the new array.
        - At ith Poisition. -O(n)
            - We would need to shift elements to the right to make space from the place of insertion

Linked List:
    - Cost of accessing an element.
        - Average time is O(n) because of traversal.

    - Memory Useage
        - No unused memory
        - extra memory for pointer variables.
        - For a linked list the memory useage also heavily depends on the data being stored.
        - Memory may be available as multiple small blocks

    - Cost of inserting an element:
        - Beginning - O(1)-Constant
            - At the beginning of a linked list if we want to insert an element at the beginning we just create a new node. Update the head to be the new node and set the pointer of the new node/head to point to the previous head.
        - At end of list.
            - O(n) this is because we need to traverse the entire list get to the end where the next pointer is null and insert and update pointers.

        - At ith posiiton. O(n):
            - This is because we still need to traverse through the list and find the spot of insertion which is proportional to the size of the array.
